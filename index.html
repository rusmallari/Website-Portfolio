                <p> Background: </p>
                <p>In 2004, my family moved from Masantol, Pampanga, to California, adjusting to life in a small two-bedroom apartment. As a first-generation college student, I navigated the challenges of a new culture, an unfamiliar educational system, and the pressure to succeed. While many expected me to pursue a medical career, I chose a different path to create better opportunities for myself and my family. This decision, though unconventional, was driven by my desire to forge a unique future.Balancing my academic goals with the responsibility of supporting my family taught me resilience and adaptability. I embraced the difficulties of this transition as chances for personal and professional growth. Over time, I realized that true growth comes from embracing challenges and change. My journey has been one of determination, where I learned to pursue my passions while maintaining my commitment to family, believing that change leads to opportunity.</p>
                <p> Education: </p>
                <p>With four years of experience in computer science, I have developed strong proficiency in C++, along with basic knowledge of C#, Java, and Python. I also have foundational skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SwiftUI, which broaden my technical expertise. This diverse skill set enables me to approach a wide range of programming challenges with flexibility and creativity. My experience allows me to write efficient, scalable code while continuously expanding my skills. This versatility makes me well-equipped to tackle various software development tasks and adapt to new technologies, ensuring effective solutions for different programming needs. </p>
                <p> Skills: </p>
                <p>Throughout my college career, I have gained valuable experience working in team settings. I have collaborated effectively on various assignments, such as creating software design presentations, maintaining connections, and ensuring smooth communication within the group. My ability to contribute ideas, support team efforts, and adapt to different perspectives has strengthened my teamwork skills. I am comfortable working with diverse groups and managing differing opinions to achieve common goals. These experiences have taught me the importance of collaboration, adaptability, and clear communicationâ€”skills that are essential for successful teamwork and project success. </p>
                <p> Hobbies: </p>
                <p>One of my main hobbies is going to the gym, as I believe physical well-being is just as important as mental well-being. Exercise is a key part of my routine, bringing me both enjoyment and a sense of fulfillment. I also love hiking, which serves as an excellent stress-reliever. Completing a challenging trail provides a strong sense of accomplishment. I appreciate that hiking can be done in a group, allowing me to connect with others while enjoying nature. Both activities are essential for maintaining balance in my life, supporting my overall health and well-being. </p>

                        to create a responsive website Portfolio, that displays information about myself, past achievements, current goals, etc. </p>
                    <p>Technologies Used: 
                        The technologies used were Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a code editor that supports multiple programming languages, with features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and extensions.
                        
                        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create and structure a website. It defines the structure and organization of a webpage.
                        
                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML content, control layout, colors, fonts, and more. It helps separate content from design, allowing customization of webpage appearance.</p>
                    <p>Challenges Faced:
                        My job conflicted with the class hours significantly, I had to learn how HTML, CSS, and Javascript worked on my own via the help of the internet. 
                        Although the internet has a vast amount of knowledge itâ€™s not very intuitive for beginners to learn.
